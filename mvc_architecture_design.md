# StockMaster - Improved MVC Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines the improved MVC architecture for the StockMaster application, focusing on separating client and admin/supervisor interfaces while maintaining a clean, modular structure.

## Core Architecture Principles

1. **Complete Separation of Concerns**
   - Model: Database structure and business logic
   - View: User interface templates
   - Controller: Request handling and response generation

2. **Role-Based Application Separation**
   - Client application: Product catalog and order management
   - Admin/Supervisor application: Complete system management
   - Shared components: Authentication, core models, utilities

3. **Security and Access Control**
   - Role-based access control at multiple levels
   - Separate authentication flows
   - Secure API endpoints

## Detailed Architecture Design

### 1. Application Structure

```
stockmaster/
├── stockmaster/          # Project settings
├── core/                 # Shared functionality
│   ├── models/           # Base models
│   ├── utils/            # Shared utilities
│   └── middleware/       # Custom middleware
├── client/               # Client application
│   ├── views/            # Client-specific views
│   ├── templates/        # Client UI templates
│   ├── forms/            # Client-specific forms
│   ├── urls.py           # Client URL routing
│   └── api/              # Client API endpoints
├── admin_portal/         # Admin/Supervisor application
│   ├── views/            # Admin-specific views
│   ├── templates/        # Admin UI templates
│   ├── forms/            # Admin-specific forms
│   ├── urls.py           # Admin URL routing
│   └── api/              # Admin API endpoints
├── static/               # Static assets
│   ├── client/           # Client-specific assets
│   ├── admin/            # Admin-specific assets
│   └── shared/           # Shared assets
└── templates/            # Base templates
    ├── client/           # Client base templates
    └── admin/            # Admin base templates
```

### 2. Models (M)

The models will be organized into logical groups:

1. **User Models**
   - User (AbstractUser extension)
   - UserProfile (Extended user information)

2. **Inventory Models**
   - Product
   - Category
   - Supplier
   - StockTransaction

3. **Order Models**
   - Order
   - OrderItem
   - OrderStatus

4. **System Models**
   - Alert
   - Message
   - Notification

### 3. Views (V)

Views will be separated by role and functionality:

1. **Shared Views**
   - Authentication (login, logout)
   - Error pages

2. **Client Views**
   - Product catalog
   - Order management
   - Profile management

3. **Admin/Supervisor Views**
   - Dashboard
   - Inventory management
   - User management (admin only)
   - Order processing
   - Reports and analytics

### 4. Controllers (C)

Controllers (Django views) will be organized by functionality:

1. **Authentication Controllers**
   - Login/logout handling
   - Registration
   - Password management

2. **Client Controllers**
   - Product browsing
   - Cart management
   - Order placement
   - Order history

3. **Admin Controllers**
   - Inventory CRUD operations
   - User management
   - Order processing
   - Report generation

### 5. URL Structure

```
/ → Landing page
/login → Shared login page
/register → Client registration

/client/ → Client dashboard
/client/catalog/ → Product catalog
/client/orders/ → Client orders
/client/profile/ → Client profile

/admin/ → Admin dashboard
/admin/inventory/ → Inventory management
/admin/users/ → User management
/admin/orders/ → Order management
/admin/reports/ → Reports and analytics
```

### 6. Authentication Flow

1. **Shared Login**
   - Single login page for all users
   - Role detection and redirection to appropriate dashboard
   - JWT-based authentication for API endpoints

2. **Registration**
   - Client self-registration
   - Admin-only creation of supervisor accounts

### 7. UI Components

1. **Client UI**
   - Product catalog with filtering and search
   - Shopping cart
   - Order history and tracking
   - Profile management

2. **Admin/Supervisor UI**
   - Dashboard with analytics
   - Inventory management
   - Order processing
   - User management (admin only)
   - Reports and exports

### 8. Responsive Design

Both client and admin interfaces will feature:
- Collapsible sidebar menu
- Mobile-friendly layouts
- Consistent styling with role-specific themes

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Core Restructuring**
   - Reorganize project structure
   - Implement role-based routing
   - Create separate base templates

2. **Phase 2: Client Application**
   - Implement product catalog
   - Develop order placement flow
   - Create client dashboard

3. **Phase 3: Admin Application**
   - Develop admin dashboard
   - Implement inventory management
   - Create user management interfaces

4. **Phase 4: UI Enhancement**
   - Improve responsive design
   - Implement collapsible sidebar
   - Enhance visual appeal

5. **Phase 5: Testing and Deployment**
   - Test role-based access
   - Verify UI functionality
   - Deploy to production
