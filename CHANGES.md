# Changes Made to Fix Login and Registration Issues

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing Required Fields in Registration Form**
   - The registration form was missing required fields such as first name, last name, and phone number
   - The form only collected username, email, and password

2. **No Error Feedback on Registration Failure**
   - When registration failed, no error messages were displayed to the user
   - The form silently failed without indicating what went wrong

3. **Login Form Confusion**
   - The login form was labeled as requiring a username, but the system actually uses email for authentication
   - No error messages were displayed when login failed

4. **Configuration Issues**
   - Missing import in views.py causing dashboard errors after login
   - ALLOWED_HOSTS configuration needed updating for testing

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Updated ClientRegistrationForm

- Added required fields:
  - First name
  - Last name

### 4. Enhanced Login Template (login.html)

### 5. Fixed Configuration Issues

## Testing Results

- Successfully created a new user with all required fields
- Verified that form validation errors are displayed when required fields are missing
- Confirmed that login form accepts email as username
- Verified that error messages are displayed when login fails

## Usage Notes

1. **Registration Process**:
   - All fields marked as required must be completed
   - Password must meet Django's default password requirements
   - Upon successful registration, users are automatically logged in

2. **Login Process**:
   - Users must use their email address (not username) to log in
   - The system will display appropriate error messages if login fails

3. **Admin Creating Supervisor Accounts**:
   - The admin interface for creating supervisor accounts remains unchanged
   - Admins can access this feature through the dashboard when logged in with admin privileges
